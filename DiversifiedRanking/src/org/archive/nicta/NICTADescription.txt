->	kernel object
	a kernel object essentially defines a space, within which we can define:
	the representation of a data point. Further, based on the defined representations, we can define
	the similarity, dissimilarity, etc.
	
	commonly, a kernel always buffer the entire documents, namely, doc_name->doc_content
	
->	ranker object
	as for the kernel based rankers, there always be member kernels, which are used to compute similarities, etc.
	
	commonly, for rankers like MMR, it runs per query, namely, the top-n documents will be refreshed each time
	as a result, for a specific query, the kernel is query oriented, because it defines the similarities of the 
	documents belonging to this query, thus the used documents of each kernel should be refreshed each time
	
	//
	
	commonly, for rankers like MDP, it runs all the mdp-like ranking methods per query, because all the mdp-like
	methods depends on the same kernel to compute similarities, etc.
